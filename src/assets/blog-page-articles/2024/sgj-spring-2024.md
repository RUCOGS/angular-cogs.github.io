This semester's theme was "**Worm**," and our submissions were _infested_ with creative games!

Games like the mash-fest "Wormoboros" and physics-based "Worm Jousting" had us competing against each other to see who would worm their way to the top. Rage game "Worm Game" and bullet-hell "Worm Odyssey" presented technically and mechanically impressive gameplay. Meanwhile, games like "Would You Still Love Me if I Was a Worm" flipped the script and asked the hard-hitting questions about love and soilmates.

Everyone involved created fascinating and impressive games that wriggled their way into our hearts. Thank you again to everyone who participated in this jam, and we hope to see you again next semester!
