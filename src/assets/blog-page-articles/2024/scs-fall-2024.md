This semester we hosted "Scarlet Showcase," an end-of semester celebration of creative clubs at Rutgers! This was a joint collaboration between COGS, VANCE, Animation Club, Digital Art Club, and RUCVGM. Throughout the event, each club hosted their own fun activities — COGS members demoed their games, VANCE members hosted live script-readings, Animation Club sold merch and presented their WIP short-film, Digital Art Club held an art workshop, and RUCVGM held a guess-the-video-game-music quiz and a mini video-game-music concert.

## Closing Remarks

I also want to thank Digital Art Club for joining us in this collaboration despite this semester being their last-semester. Unfortunately their student organization application was rejected, and they are dissolving the club by the end of the year. But I'm glad to have given them a moment in the spotlight to showcase the wonderful art they've made!

We couldn't have pulled off the event without the help of everyone involved — both the club e-boards that helped organize the event, and the regular members that attended the event. I look forward to seeing what everyone can make next semester!
