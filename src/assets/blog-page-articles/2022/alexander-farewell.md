Hello everyone!

My name is Alexander Xie, and with great sorrow I will be graduating and leaving COGS behind.

Thank you so much for this amazing 2 year journey as president, and I hope to see everyone succeed in the future. It's been a pleasure serving alongside the awesome E-Board members, and club members.

E-Board Members I would like to mention and thank - Luke Letourneau, Sarah Applebaum, Fausto J Benitez, Jessie Liang, Bridge Zhang, Victoria Chen, Justin Philips, Alan Tong, Arihant Tripathi, Aidan O'Gorman


Thank you.
Signing off for the last time as president ~
