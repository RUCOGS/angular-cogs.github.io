This semester's theme was "**One Shot**," and there were so many different submissions!

For example in the game "La Creatura", you play a photographer in charge of taking a single picture of the rarest monster you can find, with a chance of catching the ~~Freddy Fazbear~~ if you wait long enough! In "Command Obsolescence" you play a tower defense game where your turrets only have a single life, and break down after a while due to planned obsolescence.

Thanks again to everyone who participated in this jam!
