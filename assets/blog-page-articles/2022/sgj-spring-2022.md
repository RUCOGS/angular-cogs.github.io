This semester's theme was "Fish," and we had some interesting submissions.

"Feed Me" was a craft-em up about feeding fish in a pond and using the gifts they leave behind to construct buildings around the pond. "It's literally just fishing" is a game where you fish humans from the sidewalk.

Thanks again to everyone who participated in this jam!
