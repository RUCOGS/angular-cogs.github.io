This semester's theme was "Out of Order," and many submissions had creative interpretations of this theme. 

For example in the game "Whisk of Egg", you play with 1-4 players trying to hand-whisk a giant bowl of eggs because the egg whisking machine is out of order. In "Last Stop: Your Heart Chapter 2", you play through the sequel to the hit Rutgers bus dating simulator game, where the buses are out of order because they've went on strike. And in "Wild Aresenal", you play a top-down bullet-hell shmup when your weapons are randomized every so often, creating an "out of order" assortment of guns and bullets.

Thanks again to everyone who participated in this jam!
