This semester's theme was "**Bug**," and the COGS Hive proved to be a nest of creativity.

Hatching games that creatively combined the two meanings of "bug" like "Find the Bug", and while some like "Ping the Game" leaned into the computer bugs, others, such as "Exterminator", decided to avoid them alltogether by going the card-game route.

We handed out awards of recognition in various fields as well:

- COGS Choice (popular vote): Fly TD
- Artistic Excellence: Battle Bees and Mana
- Technical Excellence: Ping the Game
- Gameplay Excellence: Scaredy Spider
- Funniest Game: The Big Steppa
